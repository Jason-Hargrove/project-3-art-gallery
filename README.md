# Search the Metropolitan Museum of Art
This app lets users search for works of art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art using their Application Programming Interface. It also has the ability to create, read, update, and destroy ads inside the app.

## Features
- Search for artworks using the Metropolitan Museum of Art API.
- View details of individual artworks.
- Create, read, update, and delete ads within the application.

## Edge Cases and Known Bugs
- **Broken Image Icon**: If the API does not return an image, a broken image icon is displayed. This will be fixed in a future update.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-3-art-gallery.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:
    ```env
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```
4. Start the application:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

## Project Improvements

- **LinkedIn Integration**: I would like to see an image of my project in the Featured section on LinkedIn. I've tried several ways of setting meta properties with the Open Graph Protocol, but nothing has worked yet. I even used LinkedIn's [recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/46687/making-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin?lang=en).
