I’m a Software Engineer with a background in fine art. I tackle hidden problems by throwing myself into my work, finding connections between unrelated things, and turning my thoughts into something real. I believe the fear of the unknown can be overcome with a well designed product, and I’m passionate about presenting it in a unique way. My background in graphic design and my experience as a street artist enables me to approach each project with a spirit for communicating graphically to provoke a reaction.
