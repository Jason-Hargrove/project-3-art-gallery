# Project Improvements
I would like to be able to see an image of my project in the Featured section on Linkedin. I've tried several ways of setting meta property with Open Graph Protocol, but nothing has worked yet.

# This Is Me

I’m a Software Engineer with a background in fine art. I tackle hidden problems by throwing myself into my work, finding connections between unrelated things, and turning my thoughts into something real. I believe the fear of the unknown can be overcome with a well designed product, and I’m passionate about presenting it in a unique way. My background in graphic design and my experience as a street artist enables me to approach each project with a spirit for communicating graphically to provoke a reaction.
